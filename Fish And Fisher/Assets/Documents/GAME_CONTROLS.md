# FISH AND FISHER - GAME CONTROLS

## üêü FISH PLAYER CONTROLS

### Movement
- **W / Up Arrow** - Swim forward (maintain direction)
- **A / Left Arrow** - Turn left 60¬∞ (or 30¬∞ when pressing forward)
- **D / Right Arrow** - Turn right 60¬∞ (or 30¬∞ when pressing forward)
- **Space** - Boost speed (press rapidly for combo acceleration)

### Movement Mechanics
- The fish automatically swims forward at base speed
- You can only turn left/right - no backward movement
- Rapid Space tapping builds combo levels (max 3x) for higher speed
- Speed gradually decreases when not boosting
- Turning at high speed reduces your momentum

### Objective
**SURVIVE** until the timer runs out. Stay away from the fisher's hook!

### Game Area
- 50√ó50 unit rectangular boundary
- You cannot leave this area
